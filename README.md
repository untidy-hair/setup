setup.git
=========
Clone and run this on a new EC2 instance running Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS to
configure both the machine and your individual development environment as
follows:

```sh
cd $HOME
sudo apt-get install -y git-core
git clone https://github.com/untidy-hair/setup.git
./setup/setup.sh   
```

Edited to use Vim instead of emacs and to use tmux instead of screen.
